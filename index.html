  <h3 class="Title">The Science of Sleep</h3>
  <p>Getting enough sleep is crucial for giving your body and mind a necessary reset. Your body's internal clock follows the circadian rhythm and signals fatigue when it's time to rest. When natural light is present, your body's autonomic nervous system keeps you awake, while in the dark, it urges you to sleep. Exposure to artificial light can interfere with this balance and disrupt your sleep patterns. </p>

  <p>Sleep deprivation and deficiency can wreak havoc on your well-being, causing serious harm to your physical and mental health. It's not just about the quantity of sleep you get but also the quality and timing. When you're sleep deficient, you'll likely struggle with decision-making, problem-solving, and controlling your emotions and behavior. Research has linked chronic sleep deprivation to several diseases and conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, obesity, and depression.</p>
