    <!-- <h2 class="Title">The Sleep Deficient</h2> -->
    <p>Millions of Americans, especially teenagers and working-class adults, suffer from sleep deprivation, which can have devastating consequences on physical and mental health. As many as 70 million Americans suffer from some form of sleep disorder, causing poor performance at work and school to an increased risk of accidents, depression, and chronic diseases.</p>

<div id="Science">
  <!-- <h3 class="Title">The Science of Sleep</h3> -->
  <p>Sufficient sleep is essential for resetting your body and mind. Your circadian rhythm controls your internal clock, signaling fatigue when it's time to rest. Natural light activates your autonomic nervous system to keep you awake, and darkness prompts sleep. However, exposure to artificial light can disturb this balance and disrupt sleep patterns.</p>

  <p>Research has linked chronic sleep deprivation to several diseases and conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, obesity, and depression.</p>

<div id="General">
  <!-- <h3 class="Title">The Population</h3> -->
  <p>Sleep deficiency is a pervasive problem in America, affecting millions of individuals more than related chronic diseases. The CDC reports that over 70% of high schoolers and 30% of adults suffer from a lack of sleep.

  <!-- <h3 class="Title">The Problem</h3> -->
  <p> If you're struggling to get a good night's sleep, there are practical steps you can take to improve your sleep hygiene. You can start by avoiding caffeine and alcohol before bedtime, creating a sleep-inducing environment in your bedroom, and establishing a relaxing pre-sleep routine. Rather than constantly checking the clock, focus on getting natural light exposure during the day and sticking to a consistent sleep schedule. Resist the temptation to take long naps during the day or eat late meals, and try to exercise earlier in the day to promote restful sleep at night. By prioritizing good sleep habits, you can transform your sleep quality and wake up feeling refreshed and energized. </p>
