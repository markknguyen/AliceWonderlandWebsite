<div id="Problem"> 
  <!-- <h2 class="Title">The Sleep Deficient</h2> -->
    <p>Millions of Americans suffer from sleep deprivation, which can have devastating consequences on physical and mental health.</p>
    <p>As many as 70 million Americans suffer from a sleep disorder, causing poor performance at work and school to an increased risk of accidents, depression, and chronic diseases.</p>
  </div>

<div id="Science">
  <!-- <h3 class="Title">The Science of Sleep</h3> -->
  <p>Sufficient sleep is essential for resetting your body and mind. Your circadian rhythm controls your internal clock, signaling fatigue when it's time to rest.</p> 
  <p>Natural light activates your autonomic nervous system to keep you awake, and darkness prompts sleep. However, exposure to artificial light can disturb this balance and disrupt sleep patterns.</p>
  <p>Sleep helps regulate </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The Heart and Circulatory System</li>
    <li>Hormones and Metabolism</li>
    <li>The Respiratory and Immune System</li>
    <li>Thinking and Memory</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Research has linked chronic sleep deprivation to several diseases and conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, obesity, and depression.</p>
</div>


<div id="General">
  <!-- <h3 class="Title">The Population</h3> -->
  <p>Sleep deficiency is a pervasive problem in America, affecting millions of individuals more than related chronic diseases.</p>
  <p>The CDC reports that over 70% of high schoolers and 30% of adults suffer from a lack of sleep.</p>
</div>

<div id="Personal">
  <!-- <h3 class="Title">The Problem</h3> -->
  <p> To improve your sleeve, start avoiding caffeine and alcohol before bedtime, creating a sleep-inducing environment in your bedroom, and establishing a relaxing pre-sleep routine.</p>
  <p>Rather than constantly checking the clock, focus on getting natural light exposure during the day and sticking to a consistent sleep schedule.</p>
  <p>Resist the temptation to take long naps during the day or eat late meals, and try to exercise earlier in the day to promote restful sleep at night.</p>
  <p>By prioritizing good sleep habits, you can transform your sleep quality and wake up feeling refreshed and energized. </p>
