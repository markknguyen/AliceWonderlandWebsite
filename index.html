          <p>Millions of Americans suffer from sleep deprivation, which can have devastating consequences on physical and mental health.</p>
          <p>As many as 70 million Americans suffer from a sleep disorder, causing poor performance at work and school to an increased risk of accidents, depression, and chronic diseases.</p>

        <p>Sufficient sleep is essential for resetting your body and mind. Your circadian rhythm controls your internal clock, signaling fatigue when it's time to rest.</p> 
        <p>Natural light activates your autonomic nervous system to keep you awake, and darkness prompts sleep. However, exposure to artificial light can disturb this balance and disrupt sleep patterns.</p>
        <p>Sleep helps regulate </p>

        <p>Sleep deficiency is a pervasive problem in America, affecting millions of individuals more than related chronic diseases.</p>
        <p>The CDC reports that over 70% of high schoolers and 30% of adults suffer from a lack of sleep.</p>

      <div id="Personal">
        <p> To improve your sleeve, start avoiding caffeine and alcohol before bedtime, creating a sleep-inducing environment in your bedroom, and establishing a relaxing pre-sleep routine.</p>
        <p>Rather than constantly checking the clock, focus on getting natural light exposure during the day and sticking to a consistent sleep schedule.</p>
        <p>Resist the temptation to take long naps during the day or eat late meals, and try to exercise earlier in the day to promote restful sleep at night.</p>
        <p>By prioritizing good sleep habits, you can transform your sleep quality and wake up feeling refreshed and energized. </p>
